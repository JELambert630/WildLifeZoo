# WildLifeZoo

This project creates an interface for tracking an inventory of zoo animals. It allows the user to add and remove animals which are distinguished by unique tracking numbers. It also allows the user to display all of the animals that are currently in the system. The most challenging part of this project was properly saving to, and loading from, the .txt file that stores the animal information. I was having particular issues with loading the information from the file onto a vector without getting duplicates of the same animal. I was able to solve this issue by getting a better understanding of the .eof() function, and by clearing the contents of the vector before the information is loaded each time that the load function is called. The skill of using a program to save and load form a file can be useful in other projects because it allows the user the store data that will persist after the program is exited. I tried to make this program readable and maintainable by separating it into functions that align with the different menu options, and by commenting the areas that are not immediately understandable.
